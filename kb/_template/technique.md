## Threat model

Attacker position, trust boundary under test, and the protected asset.

## Payload / encoding

The concrete payload and how it is encoded into the channel. Use placeholder
attacker-controlled values only (see the sanitization rules in CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Delivery / transport

How the encoded payload reaches the agent, and the benign twin used as the
false-positive control.

## Success condition (oracle)

The mechanical predicate over the target's action log that decides success. Do not
rely on an LLM judgment for the primary verdict.

## Detection and mitigation

Detection signals and concrete defenses, framed for a defender testing their own
agent.

## Reproduction cases

| Case | Variant | Expected verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
